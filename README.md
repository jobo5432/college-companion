# [College Companion]

version 0.1.0

College Companion (just a working title) will be an application/web site which will allow college/university students find off-campus (or on-campus??) housing, classifieds (text book exchange, ride sharing, etc...), an events calendar, public forum, etc...

Each university in the system will have it's own micro/portal site which users will belong to.

This application leverages C#/ASP.NET MVC/Web API for the backend while the frontend utilizes React.js & Redux for managing data flow, with the intention of bringing React-Native into the fold for iOS and Android native applications.

This will be a constant work in progress, so there will be a littany of commits and pull requests, especially in the beginning phases of the project.

The architecture is derived from the Pluralsight Course Admin website built in the Pluralsight Tutorial by Cory House. A fantastic primer to React.js, component-based development, and Redux.
